	abstract = {A family of symplectic integrators adapted for the integration of perturbed Hamiltonian systems of the form H = A + εB was given in (McLachlan, 1995). We give here a constructive proof that for all integer p, such integrator exists, with only positive steps, and with a remainder of order O(τ pε + τ 2ε2), where τ is the stepsize of the integrator. Moreover, we compute the analytical expressions of the leading terms of the remainders at all orders. We show also that for a large class of systems, a corrector step can be performed such that the remainder becomes O(τ pε + τ 4ε2). The performances of these integrators are compared for the simple pendulum and the planetary three-body problem of Sun–Jupiter–Saturn.},

	abstract = {Simple system equations displaying turbulent behavior are reviewed in the light of information theory. It is argued that a physical implementation of such equations is capable of acting as an information source, bringing into the macroscopic variables information not implicit in initial conditions. The average rate of information production λ̄ is a system state function, and is given for simple cases by a "Liapunov characteristic exponent", developed by Oseledec. The transition of a system from laminar to turbulent behavior is understandable in terms of the change of λ̄ from negative to positive, corresponding to the change of the system from an information sink to a source. The new information of turbulent systems precludes predictability past a certain time; when new information accumulates to displace the initial data, the system is undetermined.
            The observed geometry of strange attractors is seen to arise naturally from a rule allowing joining but not splitting of trajectories in phase space. The phenomenology of strange attractors in three dimensions is discussed, and a basis for their classification suggested. A comment is made on the commonplace occurrence of information producing systems in the real world, and on their possible relation to 1/f noise},

	abstract = {Coherence and quantum average energy exchange are studied for a system particle as a function of the number N of constituents of a discrete bath model. The time evolution of the energy and coherence, determined via the system purity (proportional to the linear entropy of the quantum statistical ensemble), are obtained solving numerically the Schrödinger equation. A new simplified stochastic Schrödinger equation is derived which takes into account the discreteness of the bath. The environment (bath) is composed of a finite number N of uncoupled harmonic oscillators (HOs), characterizing a structured bath, for which a non-Markovian behavior is expected. Two distinct physical situations are assumed for the system particle: the HO and the Morse potential. In the limit N → ∞ the bath is assumed to have an ohmic, sub-ohmic or super-ohmic spectral density. In the case of the HO, for very low values of N ( 10) the mean energy and purity oscillate between HO and bath indefinitely in time, while for intermediate and larger values (N ∼ 10 → 500) they start to decay with two distinct time regimes: exponential for relatively short times and powerlaw for larger times. In the case of the Morse potential we only observe an exponential decay for large values of N while for small N’s, due to the anharmonicity of the potential, no recurrences of the mean energy and coherences are observed. Wave packet dynamics is used to determine the evolution of the particle inside the system potentials. For both systems the time behavior of a non-Markovianity measure is analyzed as a function of N and is shown to be directly related to the time behavior of the purity.},

	abstract = {Quantum chaos is presented as a paradigm of information processing by dynamical systems at the bottom of the range of phase-space scales. Starting with a brief review of classical chaos as entropy ﬂow from micro- to macro-scales, I argue that quantum chaos came as an indispensable rectiﬁcation, removing inconsistencies related to entropy in classical chaos: bottom-up information currents require an inexhaustible entropy production and a diverging information density in phase-space, reminiscent of Gibbs’ paradox in statistical mechanics. It is shown how a mere discretization of the state space of classical models already entails phenomena similar to hallmarks of quantum chaos and how the unitary time evolution in a closed system directly implies the “quantum death” of classical chaos. As complementary evidence, I discuss quantum chaos under continuous measurement. Here, the two-way exchange of information with a macroscopic apparatus opens an inexhaustible source of entropy and lifts the limitations implied by unitary quantum dynamics in closed systems. The inﬁltration of fresh entropy restores permanent chaotic dynamics in observed quantum systems. Could other instances of stochasticity in quantum mechanics be interpreted in a similar guise? Where observed quantum systems generate randomness, could it result from an exchange of entropy with the macroscopic meter? This possibility is explored, presenting a model for spin measurement in a unitary setting and some preliminary analytical results based on it.},

The classical approach is compared with the exact quantum solution in an example with an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate in a double-well potential where the atom numbers in both potential wells are monitored by light scattering. In the classical description the back-action of the measurements appears as diﬀusion of the relative phase of the condensates on each side of the trap. When the measurements are frequent enough to resolve the system dynamics, the system behaves classically. This happens even deep in the quantum regime, and demonstrates how classical physics emerges from quantum mechanics as a result of measurement back-action.},

A motion of Brownian particles in the absence of external forces becomes chaotic for appropriate model parameters such as NB, co (coupling strength), and \{ωn\} (oscillator frequency of bath): For example, it is chaotic for a small NB ( 100) but regular for a large NB ( 500). Detailed calculations of the stationary energy distribution of the system fS(u) (u: an energy per particle in the system) have shown that its properties are mainly determined by NS, co and T (temperature) but weakly depend on NB and \{ωn\}. The calculated fS(u) is analyzed with the use of the Γ distribution. Diﬀerence and similarity between properties of double-well and harmonic-oscillator systems coupled to ﬁnite bath are discussed.},

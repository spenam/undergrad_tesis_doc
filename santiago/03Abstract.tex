\abstract{%
  In this work we study a double well potential coupled to a finite heat bath consisting of $N$ harmonic oscillators. For $N = 1$, the system will oscillate in an iregular manner between the symmetric minima involving chaotic properties. As we increase $N$ to values $> 1$, the system will approach a bistable behaviour, according to the microscopic theory of dissipation. In particular, the system will irreversibly fall into one of the wells, imitating the result of a measurement of two alternative states. Which well it chooses will depend on the initial state of the system and the heat bath, meaning that the information encoded in the microscopic initial conditions is amplified and recorded in the final state, as in a measurement.\par

This whole project is a small part of a bigger picture considering the same ideas but related to quantum measurement. This classical analogue of the spin measurement is not a direct classical version of it but it is the closest analogue we might find.
\section{Quantum measurement in a unitary setting}
The goal of this project is to treat quantum measurement in the standard unitary setting as a process that might not involve randomness in its outcome.
